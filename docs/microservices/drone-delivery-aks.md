# Microservices reference implementation for Azure Kubernetes Service

To illustrate best practices for a microservices architecture, we created a reference implementation that we call the Drone Delivery application. This implementation runs on Kubernetes using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). You can find the reference implementation on [GitHub][drone-ri].

## Scenario

â€‹Fabrikam, Inc. is starting a drone delivery service. The company manages a fleet of drone aircraft. Businesses register with the service, and users can request a drone to pick up goods for delivery. When a customer schedules a pickup, a backend system assigns a drone and notifies the user with an estimated delivery time. While the delivery is in progress, the customer can track the location of the drone, with a continuously updated ETA.

This scenario involves a fairly complicated domain. Some of the business concerns include scheduling drones, tracking packages, managing user accounts, and storing and analyzing historical data. Moreover, Fabrikam wants to get to market quickly and then iterate quickly, adding new functionality and capabilities. The application needs to operate at cloud scale, with a high service level objective (SLO). Fabrikam also expects that different parts of the system will have very different requirements for data storage and querying. All of these considerations lead Fabrikam to choose a microservices architecture for the Drone Delivery application.

> [!NOTE]
> For help in choosing between a microservices architecture and other architectural styles, see the [Azure Application Architecture Guide](../guide/index.md).

Our reference implementation uses Kubernetes with [Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/) (AKS). However, many of the high-level architectural decisions and challenges will apply to any container orchestrator, including [Azure Service Fabric](/azure/service-fabric/).
